# The Movie Lister

I wanted to build something using a local json file and went with some movies that i found on wikipedia, specifically the top grossing movies of all time. Also building up the app from just a npm init request, install webpack and babel personnaly rather than using create-react-app, i was experimenting with an eye on learning how it is done from scratch.
